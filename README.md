# OJSandbox

An experimental sandbox for online judger.

---

This branch employs Docker container to run judger. However, due to the problems we met when we tried to use Docker API to modify the Python "frontend", we don't recommend to use this version.

Please go to branch `master` to see a better rewritten solution using Docker and RabbitMQ, or `version-1` to see a stable version without Docker.
